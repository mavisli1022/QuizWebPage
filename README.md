# Information for Graders

Please add any information that might be relevant to the grader.  This file
will not be marked, but if the grader is confused by your work, or is looking
for more information about your design decisions, or is wondering why something
doesn't quite work he or she will look here to find some insight into your
thought process. The grader will also look at the documentation in your HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript files.
